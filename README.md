Just what it says, misc scripts.

# wordpress_spam_cleanup.pl

In 2008 I was hosting a wordpress blog for a friend, and he started to get lots and lots of SPAM comments.
So I wrote this script as a way of helping to clean things up.

I have not used this script in a while, so you may want to double check the current structure of the Wordpress DB tables
to make sure that it will still do what you expect.
